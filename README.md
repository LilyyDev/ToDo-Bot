> **Installation Guide:**

**(1)** Clone this repository and save the files somewhere on your PC/Server.

**(2)** Create a Discord server (preferably a private one) to use.

**(3)** Open up the config.json file and set the options you want to use. Make sure to set your Server and Channel IDs.

**(4)** Head to the Discord developer portal and create a new bot. Put it's token in the config.json file.

**(5)** Open a terminal in the folder and run `node .` or `node . &` if you're on a server.

**(6)** Complain because I probably broke something, make an issue if you find any bugs :)

***Have a lovely day <33***
